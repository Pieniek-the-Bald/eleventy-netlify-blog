This may be my last post here. I really can't get my head around modifying 11ty page. Seems it would be easier for me to style a page builded from the beginning. 

Also, I'm not a blogger, I'm not good with written word and really struggle with having an idea how to design a page. After someone lays out what needs to be where, I can do it but comming with first and original concept never was my thing.
